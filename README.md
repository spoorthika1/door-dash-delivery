## üåü Overview

This project is a modern, responsive clone of the DoorDash food delivery platform, built to demonstrate proficiency in component-based architecture, state management, and modern JavaScript tooling.

The application allows users to browse a catalogue of virtual restaurants and dishes, manage a shopping cart, and simulate a complete checkout process.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Responsive Design**: A seamless user experience across all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop) using **[Tailwind CSS / Styled Components]**.
* **Interactive Menu Browsing**: Users can filter and search for restaurants or specific food items.
* **Shopping Cart Management**: Functionality to add, update quantities, and remove items from the cart.
* **Simulated Checkout Flow**: A multi-step form to input delivery details and complete a mock order.
* **Global State Management**: Efficient handling of application-wide data (like the cart and user session) using **[Redux Toolkit / React Context]**.
* **Type Safety**: Enhanced code quality and reduced runtime errors through the use of **TypeScript**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project was built using the following core technologies:

| Category | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend Framework** | **React** (with Hooks) | Library for building the user interface. |
| **Language** | **TypeScript** | Statically typed superset of JavaScript for reliable code. |
| **Bundler/Tooling** | **Vite** | Next-generation frontend tooling for fast development and bundling. |
| **State Management** | [Redux Toolkit / React Context] | For predictable state container and data flow. |
| **Styling** | [Tailwind CSS / Styled Components] | For utility-first styling or component-level styling. |
| **Data Fetching** | **Axios / Fetch API** | To handle asynchronous requests to the mock/real backend API. |

## üí° Future Enhancements

As part of continuous development, the following features are planned:

* **User Authentication**: Implement a secure sign-up and login flow.
* **Persistent Cart Data**: Use Local Storage or a database to save the cart across sessions.
* **Payment Integration**: Integrate a third-party payment service (e.g., Stripe) for a non-mock transaction.
* **Backend Integration**: Connect to a proper database to manage dynamic restaurant and user data.
